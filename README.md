 # Ad Clicks and Sales Analysis

This project explores the relationship between ad clicks and sales to gain insights into the effectiveness of advertising efforts. The goal is to assess whether increasing the number of ad clicks leads to a corresponding increase in sales. The analysis is conducted using a simpler linear regression model with the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method.

## Project Overview

- The `weekly_sales.csv` file contains the dataset used for the analysis, including information on ad clicks and corresponding sales.
- The `sales_adclicks.ipynb` notebook presents the step-by-step process of building the linear regression model, including data preprocessing, model fitting, and hypothesis testing.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- `weekly_sales.csv`: Dataset containing ad clicks and sales data.
- `sales_adclicks.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the code and analysis.
- `sales_adclicks.html`: html file of the notebook
- `readme.md`: Documentation file providing an overview of the project.
